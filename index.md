### developing a game is hard, a lot of work. If only things were as easy as
```
makegame(true);
```
### But where is the fun in that? Just like the Chief alawys says:
>Don't wish it were easier, wish you were better. - Chief, Animal Crossing
### *Animal Crossing* is game very similiar to [Stardew Valley](4), and Liu's on going project to develop something just like it.

### But before he can move forward with that project, there's still has a lot of things he must learn. Like how to get this [Readme](README.md) file right.




### This is a list goes on
### [x]Learn to code
### [x]learn to animate
### [ ]graduate college
### [ ]finish his game

### Alrighty folks, that's all for now. Hopefully some day he'll come back to this and give an interesting update.
