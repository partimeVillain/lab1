### Code quotes 
developing a game is hard, a lot of work. If only things were as easy as
```
int main()
{
    makegame(true);
    celebrate();
    return 0;
}
```


But where is the fun in that? Just like the Chief always says:
>Don't wish it were easier, wish you were better. - Chief, Animal Crossing


But before he can move forward with that project, there's still has a long [list](#long-term-goals) of things he must go through, like how to get this [Readme](README.md) file right.



### long term goals
The list goes on

- [x] Learn to code
- [x] learn to animate
- [ ] ace this class
- [ ] graduate college
- [ ] finish his game

### Ending
Alrighty folks, that's all for now. Hopefully some day he'll come back to this and give an interesting update.
